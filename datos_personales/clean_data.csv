Letras:

Un, dos, tres, Ave Maria
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'atras
Un dos tres
Un dos tres
Es que tiene loco
es ele que se inciende
sexy angell calido de del cielo
ella que simpre me vuelve
loco
As es Maria blanca como el día
Pero es veneno si te quieres enamorar
As es Maria tan caliente y fria
Que si te la bebes de seguro te va a matar
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'delante Maria
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'atras
Aunque me muera, ahora, Maria
Un, dos, tres un pasito pa'delante, Maria
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'atras
(Maria I want to make you mine)
Es que tiene loco
Maria es
An angel in disguise
Feeds my love with her devotion
Search for a special place to hide
As she conquers all my emotion
As es Maria,blanca como el da
Pero es veneno, si te quieres enamorar
As es Maria, tan caliente y fra
Que si te la bebes, de seguro te va a matar
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'delante Maria
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'atras
Aunque me muera, ahora, Maria
Un, dos, tres un pasito pa'delante, Maria
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'atras
(Maria I want to make you mine)
Un pasito pa'delante, un pasito pa'atras
Un pasito pa'delante, un pasito pa'atras
Un pasito pa'delante, un pasito pa'atras
Un pasito pa'delante, un pasito pa'atras
Un, dos, tres,
Un, dos, tres,
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'lante Maria
Un, dos, tres, un pasito pa'tras
As es Maria, blanca como el da
Pero es veneno, si te quieres enamorar
As es Maria, tan caliente y fra
Que si te la bebes, de seguro te va a matar

The best Office episodes are talked about a lot across the internet. The episode that usually gets mentioned is Dinner Party, which is maybe Michael Scott at his funniest, and Fire Drill is often not far behind. I think that the perfect Office episode is actually neither of those, it's the injury. This is Dwight, Jim and Michael all at their very best and funniest but it's just how much it embodies what makes the show great, that really separates it.

Tracks by the amazing GC and Lukembro!

cM5tJ2nKcC4,"In Algonquian languages, a unique feature is the classification of nouns into ""animate"" and ""inanimate"" categories.  In Spanish and French, nouns are categorized into masculine and feminine genders, and this affects other words in the sentence, like articles and adjectives. Similarly, in Algonquian languages, nouns are categorized as animate or inanimate, which influences verb conjugation and other grammatical elements. However, the basis for these categories differs. While gender in Spanish and French doesn't usually relate to physical characteristics, animate vs. inanimate in Algonquian involves complex cultural and spiritual factors, beyond mere physical life.

Understanding this aspect of Algonquian languages provides a fascinating glimpse into a different worldview shaped by unique linguistic structures.",2023-05-13T11:51:49Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cM5tJ2nKcC4/hqdefault.jpg,,24,,1532157,136711,1603,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
YLelPv8sRGI,"This is an in-depth look & review of Urusei Yatsura, a quirky series which helped shape the modern anime & manga landscape. 

We'll also be looking at the life and work of its creator, Rumiko Takahashi, and her many influences on the Japanese animation industry through the decades, from Ranma 1/2 to Inuyasha and beyond.

Regarding my pronunciation of Lum's name: I only watched the English dub recently, before then I was taking Lum's pronunciation from the Japanese pronunciation of ""Ramu."" (ラム) To me it sounded more like ""Loom,"" so that's how it came out in this video. But now I realize that's different from the English pronunciation with the short u. From now on I'll use the short u so everything lines up.

Schaut BORUTO: NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS auf Crunchyroll: https://got.cr/2JIdnBF

BORUTO: NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS - Inhalt:

Das Dorf hinter den Blättern befindet sich in einem Zeitalter des Friedens und der Moderne. Riesige Gebäude wachen über die Straßen, gigantische Bildschirme zeigen ihre Farben und die Donnerbahn rast durch das Dorf, um alle Distrikte zu verbinden. Auch wenn es noch ein Dorf von Ninjas ist, wuchs die Bevölkerung enorm und das Leben der Ninja ändert sich langsam. Boruto Uzumaki, der Sohn Narutos , tritt der Ninja Akademie bei, um die Wege der Ninja zu erlernen. Seine Mitschüler sehen ihn nur als ""Sohn des Hokage"", doch seine Passion und sein Charakter blasen alle Vorurteile bald davon.

Get a Photon D2 DLP printer: https://bit.ly/3B7MIKx

In this episode, we bust open a rare DLP resin printer to show how microelectromechanical systems - nay, microOPTOelectromechanical systems, make impossible tasks trivial. This fusion of SRAM, electrostatic actuators, micromachined springs, and graphics circuitry enables us to build incredibly precise, powerful, and high-performance displays. There's a science fair model, tiny Warframes, a projector that's also a car headlight, half a snake, and penny-pinching regret. It's a fun time.

About the title: the Photon D2's resolution is 2560x1440, but on the DLP chip, those pixels are surrounded by a buffer zone of partially-broken micromirrors. It's a method of increasing production yield, and means that even though this 2k printer drives 3.68 micromirrors, the chip itself contains well over four million in total. Most of those could function, but the display driver leaves them in the neutral position to keep the resolution predictable.

If you have any interest at all in what you just saw and you’d like to learn more, we HIGHLY recommend watching the Blind Surfer documentary called “Finding A Way – The Story of the Blind Surfer”.  This 26 minute piece will bring a whole new perspective to everything you watch on this channel.
https://youtu.be/8pD_9Ym6k70 

Here’s a little more on Pete along with some FAQ’s

Pete was diagnosed at the age of 8 with macular degeneration. The disease would later be renamed as Stargadt's because it affected Pete so young and needed to be reclassified. Pete was born with perfect eyesight, but the genetic disorder began to eat away at his eyesight from the moment of his birth rendering him legally blind by the age of 8 and without any ""functional"" eyesight by his mid-30's. 
Q: is Pete's eyesight completely black? 
A: No. Pete sees a jumble of light and dark. There are no distinct shapes and this ""non-functional"" eyesight makes it impossible to process the information his eyes are sending to his brain. Clicking on the following episode will show you a number of visual examples of how Pete sees: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU8YdjpsbsI&feature=youtu.be 

Q: How is Pete reading and responding to these comments? 
A: Pete does not read comments. Pete does not ""read"" anything. He uses Text to Speech technology and the Voice Over feature on his iPhone.  You can see an entertaining 58 second demonstration here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ZjDAUi3Sc&feature=youtu.be

Q: why does it look like he's looking at the camera? 
A: The camera looks at Pete. He does not look at the camera unless he has been given a ""mark"" or is following a predetermined and pre-discussed route of the camera. Please refer to the start of this episode for more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g6M2VbtW1k&t=1s 

Q: can Pete type? 
A: yes. Pete has fingers. Pete can type. Pete also uses the dictate feature on his phone just like millions of Americans who like to dictate faster than they can type. 

Q: How does Pete get around? 
A: Pete gets around with the help of a cane, his guide dog Superdog and his friends. When you see him on camera, many routes have been pre-plotted for the ease of viewing. To see how Pete gets to his spot on the beach, please check out the 48 second mark of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HZ9_Hc2Ums&feature=youtu.be 

Q: Why does Pete have eyes? 
A: being blind does not mean that you don't have eyes. It just means that they don't' work 

Q: So why is he looking at stuff when he talks? 
A: Pete's ears work fine so he can hear where voices are coming from and looks in the direction of those voices. 

Q: Why is Pete wearing sunglasses 
A: Most blind people wear sunglasses because they make really poor eye contact and it’s a little off-putting to people in the sighted world to be looking at someone who isn’t really looking back. Also, since Pete’s eyes can’t regulate the amount of light coming into his pupils, direct exposure to bright sunlight can cause pretty un-fun headaches so he keeps the shades on to keep the unregulated and indistinct bright light out. 

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. The Blind Surfer channel is always happy to help spread awareness and information about blindness and how it affects tens of millions of people worldwide.",2022-03-04T18:00:14Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jj5a1J-gVXk/hqdefault.jpg,,27,,1078530,128364,290,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Ahora te Puedes Marchar""

Letras:
Si tú me hubieras dicho siempre la verdad
Si hubieras respondido cuando te llamé
Si hubieras amado cuando te amé
Serías en mis sueños la mejor mujer
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Si tú superas lo que yo sufrí por ti
Teniendo que olvidarte sin saber por qué
Y ahora me llamas, me quieres ver
Me juras que has cambiado y pensas en volver
Si no supiste amar ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar
Contigo yo perdí, ya tengo con quién ganar

Ya sé que no hubo nadie
Que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso comprendo que estás aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar
Contigo yo perdí, ya tengo con quién ganar

Ya sé que no hubo nadie
Que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso comprendo que estás aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

F8U-0AUxb3M,"Why Banana Flavoured Foods Don't Taste Like Banana

Why don't banana flavoured foods taste anything like bananas? Well, bananas haven't always tasted the same as they do now. If you bought a banana in the early 1900s, it's likely that you were buying the fatter more flavourful cousin of our modern banana known as the Gros Michel, which translates in English to Big Mike. That Banana flavour you taste in milkshakes and sweets is isoamyl acetate a compound that is produced by ripening fruit and in particular from Big Mike. But then in the 1950s came the Panama disease, a fungus that completely wiped Big Mike off the planet. So what are these? This is the Superman of Panama Disease resistance, the Cavendish banana. But these have drastically different flavour from Big Mike, mainly due to their significantly lower levels of isoamyl acetate, making it taste completely different from banana flavoured foods. But why don't banana flavoured foods taste anything like bananas? If you bought a banana in the early 1900s, it's highly likely that you were buying the far more flavourful cousin of our modern banana known as the Grosse Michel, which translates into English as Big Mike. That banana flavour you taste in milkshakes and sweets is isoamyl acetate. A compound is naturally produced by ripening fruit and in particular from Big Mike.",2023-01-23T17:48:30Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F8U-0AUxb3M/hqdefault.jpg,,24,en-GB,5881418,418717,2975,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

EPjrFjAxwlw,"Professor Antony Davies explains the many miss-understandings about Government Debt. Myth 1 is that the government owes “only” $20 trillion. (In reality, it’s much more.) But luckily, Myth 10 is that there’s no way to fix this problem… 

‎️‍🔥 For more content like this watch Prof. Antony Davies' Answers to the Most Googled Economics Questions: https://youtu.be/NVv_StQXHSI ‎️‍🔥

🎙️ Professor Davies also co-hosts a PODCAST! Find him and James R. Harrigan in the Words & Numbers podcast: https://wordsandnumbers.libsyn.com/ 🎙️

Myth number one, the government owes $20 trillion. How much is $20 trillion? Suppose you go to Germany, and in Germany, you go to every town. In every town, you visit every store. In every store, you look at every shelf and grab everything that is for sale. The amount of money you spend will not be $20 trillion. If you go to Germany and then to France and you go to every town, and within every town, you go to every store. In every store, you look on every shelf and you buy everything. You still will not have spent $20 trillion. You can go to England and while you’re there, you can go to the North Countries and buy everything that’s for sale, and you still will not have spent $20 trillion. In fact, to spend $20 trillion, you have to go to every country in Europe, visit every town, in every town, go to every store. In every store, look on every shelf and buy everything. And then you will have spent about $20 trillion.

But the myth is that this is how much money the government owes. It turns out that there’s more, called unfunded obligations. Unfunded obligations is money the Federal Government has promised but which it does not and will not have the money to pay. Largely, this consists of promises of retirement and medical benefits. If you would take the present value of all the future promises of retirement and medical benefits the government has made and subtract from that the amount of money that’s in the government’s Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and then subtract from that the amount of money the Federal Government anticipates collecting under the current law from future Social Security and Medicare taxes, you will still have an amount of money left over that the government does not have.

K-urpE_ckug,"After an extended hiatus, Bleach, by Kubo Tite (Kubo Taito) has returned full force with Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War. While its manga run has officially concluded, Bleach thousand year blood war acts as the final arc's animated adaptation, nearly 6 years in waiting.

Released in 2001 and continued for 15 years, Bleach was and continues to be one of the most recognizable manga/anime franchises to date, along with others like One Piece and Dragon Ball.

Featuring Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Uryu Ishida, Renji Abarai, Yasutora Sado (Chad), and Orihime Inoue, the band of main characters (mainly Ichigo and Rukia) get swept up in conflicts between humans, soul reapers, and eventually fullbringers.

Bleach is currently airing this Fall 2022 season along with Chainsaw Man, Spy x Family part 2, Mob Psycho 100 season 3, and others.

Here it is folks. The longest video on this channel. And it's about a well made movie from the 80's that consisted entirely of puppets. And it was able to scare me even to this day. Jim Henson was amazing.

I gave this person (fanboy flicks) a shoutout at the begining of the video. He makes good videos talking about bad moveis. I like him  ➤ https://www.youtube.com/user/FanboyFlicks

About Ben Bailey:
 
Long before he got behind the wheel of “Cash Cab,” Ben Bailey left his home in a small town in New Jersey and headed to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of a career in show business. Six weeks later he found himself on stage at The Comedy Store. Shortly thereafter, Bailey returned to the East Coast and started hanging out at the comedy clubs in New York City. He quickly became a crowd favorite and has since performed at all the major festivals - Montreal and Chicago (Just for Laughs), the (hallowed and former) Aspen Comedy Arts Festival and The Edinburgh Fringe Festival - as well as at clubs and theaters around the world.
 
By 2005, Bailey had appeared in several commercials, on Fox's ""MADtv"" and became a regular on ""Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn."" He also made stand up appearances on HBO, NBC, ""Star Search,"" ""Last Call with Carson Daly"" and ""The Late Show.""
 
Bailey drove the smash hit series “Cash Cab” (still in syndication around the world) for over 550 episodes. The show ran from 2005-2012 and again from 2017-2019 (https://bravotv.com/cash-cab). Bailey was nominated four times for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host, winning the award in 2010, 2011 and 2013. “Cash Cab” won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show in 2008, 2009 and 2010. In 2013, the show appeared in TV Guide's list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.
 
He’s also hosted several other TV shows - including NBC’s ""Who's Still Standing,"" ""Best in The Business,"" Discovery’s ""After the Catch"" and NatGeo’s “Brain Games” - and appeared in multiple pilots.
 
Bailey starred in two specials for Comedy Central (https://on.cc.com/37nVgRf). He released ""Road Rage and Accidental Ornithology"" (https://amzn.to/3I4QiFx) in 2011; and “Ben Bailey: Live and Uncensored” in 2016 (https://amzn.to/3pZJClT).
 
Bailey has appeared on """"The Tonight Show,” ''The Today Show,"" ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" ""Rachel Ray"" and virtually every major morning show (TV and radio) in the country. He’s has appeared in numerous TV shows including ""30 Rock,"" “Blue Bloods,” ""Parenthood,"" ""Law and Order SVU,"" “Perpetual Grace,” “Unforgettable,” ""Hope & Faith,"" ""The Knights of Prosperity"" and ""One life to Live,"" as well as several films including ""Bad Parents,"" ""Don't Shoot the Pharmacist"" and ""Bad Meat.""
 
Bailey currently tours the country as a national headliner. You can see him live at a comedy club in your area (cities and dates: https://therealbenbailey.com) or watch his stand-up on his YouTube channel, “Ben Bailey Comedy.”",2022-11-30T22:39:39Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CnsQGGYmL2o/hqdefault.jpg,comedy,23,,1791194,137943,929,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Content Warning:
Part one shows clips of crude humour that include jokes that degrade people for characteristics such as appearance, race, gender, and sexuality. Brief clips are also shown of cartoon violence. 

Spoiler Warning:
Part one contains minor spoilers for Archer season 3. Part two contains major spoilers for Paradise PD's plot developments in seasons 1 - 2. Part three contains minor spoilers for Fresh Meat season 3. Farzar goes unspoiled throughout all three parts. Brickleberry resets the status quo after every episode so there are no major plot developments to spoil, however several individual episodes have their stories spoiled. That being said though if you care about Brickleberry, Paradise PD, or Farzar spoilers something's gone wrong.",2022-10-12T19:11:26Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oz04mSryFFo/hqdefault.jpg,,24,,1333970,45031,4176,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

■□■ INTRODUCTION ■□■
「潮が死んだ―――。」

幼馴染・小舟潮の訃報を聞いた網代慎平は、
2年ぶりに故郷である和歌山市・日都ヶ島に帰ってきた。

家族や友人との再会。滞りなく行われていく葬儀。
しかし、親友・菱形窓は「潮の死には不審な点があり、他殺の可能性がある」と慎平に告げる。

翌日、近隣の一家が突如として全員消えてしまう事件が発生。
時を同じくして、慎平はある不吉な噂を耳にする。

「自分にそっくりな“影”を見た者は死ぬ。
影に殺される――！」

さらに、潮の妹・澪が「お姉ちゃんが亡くなる3日前に影を見た」と言いだして……！？

紀淡海峡に浮かぶ夏の小さな離島で、
時をかけるSFサスペンスが、今幕を開ける――！

In the process, Buzzfeed has experienced less viewership, layoffs and pay-cuts, hinting at the rough seas that Buzzfeed happens to be sailing through. Many considered Ryan and Shane from Buzzfeed Unsolved to be the only thing keeping Buzzfeed afloat, with them gone, who knows what lies in the future for Buzzfeed?

9vJRopau0g0,"When 50,000 of Mark Rober's 3 million YouTube subscribers participated in a basic coding challenge, the data all pointed to what Rober has dubbed the Super Mario Effect. The YouTube star and former NASA engineer describes how this data-backed mindset for life gamification has stuck with him along his journey, and how it impacts the ways he helps (or tricks) his viewers into learning science, engineering, and design. Mark Rober has made a career out of engineering, entertainment, and education. After completing degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California, Rober joined NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2004. In his nine years as a NASA engineer, seven of which were on the Mars rover Curiosity team, Rober worked on both the Descent Stage (the jet pack that lowered the Rover to the surface) and some hardware on the Rover top deck for collecting samples. In 2011, Rober’s iPad-based Halloween costume helped launch both his creative costume company, Digital Dudz, and his YouTube channel, which now boasts 3 million subscribers and 400 million views. His videos focus on creative ideas and science- and engineering-based pranks and activities. Rober is a regular guest on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"". Today, he does research and development work for a large technology company in Northern California, where he lives with his wife and son.

Las pandillas y el narcotráfico han vuelto al escenario diario del pequeño país de Ecuador. Desde las masacres carcelarias de 2021, la violencia se ha apoderado de las calles y la inseguridad se ha convertido en la mayor preocupación del pueblo ecuatoriano. 

¿Cómo ha llegado el país hasta este punto? ¿Quiénes son los principales responsables de esta situación? ¿Por qué han asesinado a Fernando Villavicencio? ¿Qué significa realmente el trágico asesinato del candidato? Hoy te lo contamos.

EDIT (March 2023): The ending of this video includes some predictions on the future on VTubing, including the possibility and implications of a truly ""AI"" VTuber. As of December 2022, this prediction came true with the debut of Neuro-sama just one month after the release of ChatGPT, which lead to mass debate about AI and the possibility of AGI, a heavily philosophical question. Given such hindsight, this video does not provide nearly enough nuance to this now-widespread and controversial topic so please forgive the oversimplification.

Corrections:
- [Visual error at 25:09] ""Nvidea"" should be Nvidia

Footnotes (cut for time):
 - Woody Bledsoe later on went on to make contributions in early A.I. pattern recognition. An unknown amount of the research in the Facial Recognition Project is missing, and the research group the report was submitted to (King-Hurley Research group) was found to be a front for the CIA. The CIA stated that it could neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of the report in 2014.
 - Modern marker-based mocap systems can also use LEDs rather than reflective or retroreflective material, which can be more easily detected.
 - CodeMiko's mocap hardware involves a combination of an Xsens suit, a pair of Manus VR gloves, and a MOCAP Design facial tracking helmet (which is just a helmet attached to an iPhone X). The suit and gloves use various accelerometer and gyroscope sensors attached to the body to detect motion.
 - Infrared light has a wavelength longer than visible light and is commonly used for night vision and surveillance, as it is radiated naturally by humans.
 - PrimeSense, the company that designed the Xbox Kinect, was acquired by Apple in 2013 to design the TrueDepth camera. Thus, it can be assumed that TrueDepth's IR technology works similarly to the Kinect.
 - The stereo mesh solver from OpenCV can create a 3D surface mesh using an array of cameras at different angles to a face, similar to the Pixel's uDepth.
 - Another regression model is logistic regression, which puts the hypothesis through a sigmoid function to bound it between 0 and 1 and compares it to a threshold, thus predicting classification (0 or 1 rather than a range of numbers). The sigmoid function is a common activation function for neural networks.
 - The cost function is sometimes referred to as the ""loss function"". These terms are *generally* interchangeable.
 - The first ConvNet model used for computer vision was by Yann LeCun et al. in 1989. LeCun was one of the first to use backpropagation and was able to recognise hand-written numbers. This model would later be called the LeNet.
 - Facial recognition (classification) models can also use statistical approaches such as PCA or LDA for dimension reduction.
 - Tensorflow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence developed by the Google Brain team. Pre-trained models are available for use and further training via the Tensorflow Model Zoo.
 - There are three basic machine learning paradigms: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Facial landmark detection uses supervised learning, in which it trains off of labelled training data.
 - Landmarks are usually mapped to a 3D model by the bones of the model (which the renderer uses as a guide to move the rest of the model). The movement does not have to be exact to the captured landmarks. For example, an avatar could have a different degree of skin elasticity.
 - Both Hololive and Nijisanji began for their respective mobile AR apps: The hololive app for iOS and Android and the Nijisanji app for iOS.
 - Hololive has several other branches besides Hololive English. International branches include Hololive Indonesia and Hololive China (though Hololive China was shut down following political controversy). Holostars is the male-only branch. 
 - OpenSeeFace's models are trained from scratch using MobileNet V3 architecture as a backbone. MNV3 is a ConvNet designed for mobile phone CPUs. The final landmark determination step also doesn't use normal linear regression, but a heatmap based approach with offset vectors, where UNet upscaling layers follow after the MNV3 feature extraction. Thank you Emiliana_vt for this detail.
 - Kizuna AI went on indefinite hiatus in February 2022 following a last livestream titled ""hello, world 2022"".

While China is struggling with an unprecedented wave of coronavirus, and tens of millions are getting infected daily, the world’s second-largest economy is starting to show signs of coming back to life following the government’s decision last month to dismantle the zero-Covid system that aimed to control the virus at the cost of keeping the country isolated.

Investors and analysts predict a brighter year ahead after disrupted supply chains and forced stoppages on factory floors have ended, but the Chinese Economy still faces numerous challenges.  The government have discussed rolling back the Three Red Lines Policy that burst the real estate bubble.

In this Broadcast Award-winning, BAFTA and Emmy Award-nominated entertainment show, Taskmaster tyrant Greg Davies (Man Down, Cuckoo), with the help of his loyal assistant Alex Horne (The Horne Section and the show’s creator), sets out to test the wiles, wit and wisdom of five hyper-competitive comedians.

Comedians that have risked life, limb, and dignity in the hope of making the Taskmaster proud so far include: Frank Skinner (The Frank Skinner Show), Mel Giedroyc (The Great British Bake Off), Romesh Ranganathan (Asian Provocateur), Hugh Dennis (Outnumbered), Sally Phillips (Bridget Jones’ Diary), Rose Matafeo (Edinburgh Comedy Award Winner 2018), and Russell Howard (The Russell Howard Hour). Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness’ golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion.",2020-09-22T17:00:21Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dtVKaGpn8Gg/hqdefault.jpg,,23,,3367066,63227,2269,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Irresistible growling choruses from the port side and lively keyboard melodies and heavy metal riffs from the starboard side form the basis of this highly explosive rum-induced metal mix. The catchy tales of life on the high seas, including ""Keelhauled"" or  ""The Quest"", use authentic instruments (violin, horns) to give these maritime jewels their final polish.  Producer Lasse Lammert (LSD Studio) has given ""Black Sails at Midnight"" a unique and powerful sound, which earned him many a wench and much wealth from Captain Morgan's personal stash, while James Murphy, known for his outstanding work with Death and Obituary, took over the mastering responsibilities.  The album's limited edition includes a live bonus DVD featuring the buccaneer's entire 2008 Wacken performance.  Alestorm have hoisted the black sails...Let the raids begin!

il4TkESwGE8,"SpiceDAO raised 2.66 million euros to purchase at auction, a rare book containing the script, concept art and pre production materials for an unreleased Dune film from Alejandro Jodorowsky. This auction estimated the value of the book to be between 25 and 35 thousand euros. They paid 2.66 million euros for it and assumed this would mean they could make animated series based on the book. Unfortunately before spending 100x the value for the book, no one told them this is in fact not how copyright works.

m_a0fN48Alw,"Where is the slow coming from?

How do you make your Python code faster? The first step is measuring what part is actually slow. We do this using a profiler, such a cProfile. The profiler measures how much time all your function calls take and then you can print or save these statistics to determine where you should spend your time improving. Take your profiling to the next level using a graphical tool like snakeviz to analyze the stats.

I go through a simple example where I go from start to finish diagnosing and fixing some slow code using these techniques. Here we ended up using async/await to fix the problem, but the tools in this video can be used to diagnose all sorts of code problems.

Animator Yamanaka Misaki: I wanted the audience to enjoy the character’s expressions, so I was careful of the timing in changing the facial gadgets. In the scene where a cabbage hits Darkness, I made effort in shooting the moment and body angle when it hit her. 

Director Shinohara Kenta: This shoot actually took 35 hours. We shot about 202 frames. It takes an enormous amount of time to shoot one stop motion film. To make a new stop motion film every week, we must standardize the making process. We must bring to life any kind of character in size, and shape. All our Animist staff are in training every day.

More about Rescue HQ - The Tycoon (from Steam):

Build up your headquarters from scratch and design your own masterpiece. In Rescue HQ you build, organize and manage a joint station for the three emergency departments fire brigade, police and ambulance. With limited budget you will be facing tough decisions and extensive emergencies that will need your immediate attention. During all of that you will further develop your HQ, hire new crew members and provide them with all the vehicles and equipment they need. Can you keep cool in heated up situations and will you do whatever it takes to keep your city safe? 

You are the police – Send appropriate forces with specific vehicles (from patrol car to SWAT unit) to dangerous emergency missions to keep your city safe. Provide them with the right gear from snipers to tracker dogs, bomb defusal kits and much more…

Bring back prisoners and evidence from the crime scenes, interrogate them and process the files to earn money. You will need the funds to set up for big events like the trial of a mafia boss or preparations for the football championship ending up in major riots in your city.

You are the fire brigade – Get ready for the rush of incoming emergencies and make sure your team has the right vehicles and resources to handle them. Train your firefighters to develop unique skills allowing them to become experts for specific mission types. Assign them to different shifts based on their skills and supply them with special gear from air tanks to hazmat suits for chemical emergencies. 

You are the ambulance – Look after your patients in the medical station of your HQ and expand it with the latest technologies from radiology stations to 3D printers. It’s your responsibility to keep all your patients safe and provide your medic team with the needed items from crash cart to contamination suits and medical kits.

As the manager of your HQ it’s your job to always keep track of everything. In times of resource and time scarcity, good planning and well-considered compromises are demanded. 

Show that you got what it takes to successfully complete multidisciplinary emergencies involving all three departments while keeping your crew happy and healthy. Make use of more than 20 vehicles including helicopters, tons of different equipment, skills and items to set up your rescue masterpiece. 

Can you keep cool and stay on top of the situation, despite three departments, numerous missions, and scarce resources demanding your attention? Prove your skills, your city counts on you!

Three emergency departments under one roof allowing for different challenges and strategies
Build and expand your headquarter
Two different settings, based on San Francisco and Berlin, with corresponding vehicles
Challenging resource management
Unforeseen and diverse missions
Huge “scurrying factor” due to personnel that follow their routines

Firefighting department – Large operations with a lot of equipment, vehicles and people involved
Purchase property to expand your headquarters and fill it with department specific rooms as well as common rooms that improve the mood and health of you employees
Get paid by the city mayor based on your performance
Earn rewards from successfully completed emergencies – either directly in form of money and reputation, delayed as with paperwork, patients and prisoners, or more complex like new team members, work stations, new unlocks, etc. 
Long-term scenario that presents challenges to you providing waves of emergencies at specific times. Check the timeline and make sure you are ready for them!
Objectives and achievements that guide you through the game experience and will keep the game challenging at all times

Better Call Saul is the prequel to the award-winning series Breaking Bad, set six years before Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) became Walter White's lawyer. When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is ""fixer"" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts ""criminal"" in ""criminal lawyer.""

xFtNDZuIPwU,"This is one of my all time favorite parks and rec bloopers out there, great tv show and an amazing cast to go along with it, if you haven't seen Parks and Recreation I highly suggest you binge-watch it!

Parks and Recreation is a comedy about government workers in Pawnee, Indiana.

the show is full of laughs and might have the best bloopers of a long-running tv series right next to the office in terms of videography.

A little more about parks and rec...

Parks and Recreation (also known as Parks and Rec) is an American political satire mockumentary sitcom television series created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The series aired on NBC from April 9, 2009, to February 24, 2015, for 125 episodes, over seven seasons. A special reunion episode aired on April 30, 2020.


the person that made the blooper was Andy Dwyer, or Chris Pratt the actor's names, standing alongside his power cast...

Amy Poehler (Leslie Knope) Rashida Jones (Ann Perkins) Aubrey Plaza (April Ludgate) Aziz Ansari (Tom Haverford) Jim O'Heir (Jerry Gergich) Retta (Donna Meagle) and who could forget... Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson)


one of the funniest tv shows IMO lol, let me know what you think... Blow this up!

I recently watched the newest MCU Disney+ series and uhhh have some thoughts. A video on the implications of media representation is actually an idea I've had since before starting my channel.  Although it's a topic that relates to movies, shows, and video games alike, I didn't make the vid cause I didn't have a piece of media I wanted to talk about, but watching Ms. Marvel gave me some talking points and inspired me to act on the video idea. If you still reading, I got a new mic and am still kinda figuring it out but lmk how it sounds!

In this extended interview, I ask Dr. Paul about his latest confrontation with Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Fauci recently said that his critics, like Senator Paul, are ""really criticizing science, because I represent science.”  That’s arrogant.

Paul calls it “reminiscent of the medieval Church,” and he says new evidence proves Fauci did in fact play a part in funding gain of function research in China.

WvJBXWiSkTU,"Android Video Meeting App Development | Episode #1 | Project Setup | Primary Layout Design

Welcome.

In this tutorial series, we will build a video meeting or conference application from scratch. First of all, let's understand the idea of this application. To implement real-time activity like video meetings we must have some identity or destination link to the receiver. 

For that users will sign up for their account using some basic details like the first name, last name, email, and password. To store all of the user data we will be using the cloud fire store database, which is a flexible and scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

After sign up, the user will sign in to their account using email and password. We will store logged user information into shared preferences to handle auto-sign in so users don't need to enter email and password every time.

After sign in, we will display a list of other users that are signed up in our application except for the currently logged user because nobody is going to start a video meeting with himself.

In a video meeting, the user will initiate the video meeting by sending a meeting invitation to another user. To send a meeting invitation we will use firebase cloud messaging which is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost. Using FCM, you can notify a client app that a new email or other data is available to sync.

Once the meeting invitation sent, the receiver has two options, accept or reject the invitation. On acceptance or rejection, the related response message will be sent to the meeting initiator or sender. If the user wants to cancel the meeting invitation then it can be done by the hang-up process, in which another remote message will be sent to the receiver to cancel the current meeting invitation. This is the complete meeting invitation process.

On acceptance of the meeting invitation, the video meeting will start using the Jitsi Meet. To implement video meetings or conferences lots of groundwork is needed, to simplify this process we will use a pre-built Jitsi Meet client which is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). It allows audio and video communication to work inside applications and web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps. This Jitsi Meet client provides the facilities like, switch sound devices, invite more people to the meeting, audio-only mode, toggle camera, tile view in case of more people. The best part is you can also start chat conversion during video meetings.

Hello, in this tutorial series we are going to build an android app called: Video Meeting (Conference) App. This tutorial series is going to be a FREE complete Android development course.

In this episode #1, we will set up our android studio project, add dependencies and simply design the primary layout for our app which includes two screens,

Finding the center of a square block is easy.  A couple lines connecting both corners, and X marks the spot.  If you’re looking for the center to a cylinder or a circle, you can either buy or make a center finder.  But what if you’re looking for the center of an incongruent shape?  I have a log here that I’d like to turn on my lathe to round.  If I use my center finder, I can try to come at it with different angles to find a general center, but it’s still more of an abstract guess.

Instead, we’ll quickly take a piece of acrylic, find the center by connecting the diagonals.  We’ll drill the center out and remove the backing.  

Now find a thin strip of wood that’s the radius of the circle, drill a hole on one end and then holes in half inch increments.  Add a bolt and a nut to the center and we’ll quickly draw circles from the inside out.  With our acrylic bullseye that we made we can now place this on top of incongruent objects to get a closer estimation to where the center is.  With the 1/2” ring sizes,  it makes it a little easier to center the top.

Part 1: https://youtu.be/ivVzGpznw1U
Part 3: https://youtu.be/15zHLXvFUs0

The primary source on all things SSC is the book ""Tunnel Visions"", which I used as a blueprint to map out the series. Many of the quotes are taken from that book, which used primary interviews and are sourced very extensively. Stuff involving budgets and congress I accessed from the official government websites, including votes on bills and amendments, and inflation calculations were done by myself using an online tool. There are a bunch of other documents I read through such as ""The Global Research and Development Landscape and Implications for the Department of Defense"", ""A TIMELINE OF MAJOR PARTICLE ACCELERATORS"", ""United States nuclear forces, 2019"", ""High Energy Physics Advisory Panel's Subpanel on Vision for the Future of High-Energy Physics May 1994"", ""The Intellectual Spoils of War?

UwLnpYU9jR0,"Network theory is the study of relationships - whether it be connections between characters in your fravourite TV show, real people, computers, or anything. Here we take a guided tour of what networks are, how they arise in nature, and what they can teach us.

I am trying to aim for quality over quantity with these videos. If you want to support the channel consider checking out my patreon: patreon.com/NotDavidYoutube

CITATIONS/ FOOTNOTES:

1. 3:15 Fragility of a network can be defined by the quantiative and qualitative changes in the network structure due to the removal of one or many nodes (or links). This can be done randomly or in a targeted fasion. A ring network is susceptible to both. Something like a small world network (defined later in the video) is susceptible to targeted removal of nodes but not random removal of nodes. This is an important consideration in critical infrastructure networks (power grids, internet, etc.).

2. 3:54 This is optimistic as I only considered unweighted undirected networks. For either directed or weighted networks, this number would expload even faster. Don't worry if this doesn't mean anything to you though.

3. 4:19 The two graphs on the left are called ""random"" networks (which will potentially be a future topic) where as the one on the right is potentially a small world network.

4. 4:44 In network neuroscience there is the distinction between structural networks (e.g., following the connections of physical neurons or brain regions) or functional networks (e.g., formed by looking at which neurons activate together). We will touch on this more in a future video on network inference. 

5. 5:15 6 Degrees of Seperation and the Kevin Bacon number are really the same thing more or less. There are also a lot of problems with the original 6 Degrees of Seperation experiment, which we will touch on in the network inference video in the future. 

6. 5:26 This is not a rigerous definition of small world networks. Typically one has to consider whats called the average path length, and how it scales as a function of the number of nodes. In many real world systems though this is difficult to do as you can't simply add nodes. 

7. 5:42 For example, for the year of 2019, 15 airports accounted for 10% of world wide travel, despite the fact that they only acount for 0.03% of airports.

8. 6:16 Its a bit more complicated this as these are actually typically formed by what are called hyper-networks or hypergraphs where in we have different types of nodes. You wouldn't want a purely small world network because, as mentioned in citation 1, small world networks are susceptible to targeted network attacks.

9. 6:27 Paper: ""Emergence of a Small-World Functional Network in Cultured Neurons""
Julia H. Downes et. al.
and
""Self-organization of in vitro neuronal assemblies drives to complex network topology""
Prciscila C. Antonello et. al.
(the second has a preprint on Biorxiv and should be free to access there)

10. 7:01 Much of this analysis has been attributed to Jacob Moreno, though it appears that the majority (if not all) of this work was conducted by his assistant Helen Hall Jennings as Moreno was not mathematically motivated nor was he particularly interested in systematic research. Unfortunently this is not uncommon in science. 

Footnote 7:50 -- Bojack Horseman

11.  8:06 If you're interested in more, Networks: An Introduction by Mark Newman is a great introduction into the field. 

12. This is from Evalina Gabasova's 2015 blog entry ""The star wars social network"" (you should be able to just google that), I highly recommend it. I unfortunently was not able to find the kpop group network again. If I find it in the future I'll edit this.

What Is A Trill And What Does It Mean?

Simply put, trilling is a form of vocalization which cats make in order to express themselves. Of course, cats make a range of different sounds, from meowing to chirps, purrs to hisses. Unlike many of the other sounds however, such as meowing, the trilling sound is produced with a closed mouth. Rather than expel the air, when a cat trills, the air is actually pushed through their vocal cords.

It’s best described as a high-pitched sound, very similar to the soft rolling Rs typically associated with Spanish. Quite often the sound produced is fairly short, lasting only one or two seconds. The trilling sound is usually associated with positive emotions and more high-pitched sounds. On the other hand, meowing can indicate positive or negative connotations and, similarly to purring, tends to be a lower or deeper sound.

Reasons Your Cat May Trill

Cats trill for a multitude of reasons. Generally, the reasons behind trilling tend to be very positive. A cat’s willingness to trill can, in part, be seen as a sign of their comfort, ease and trust in you.

A Form Of Communication

The trilling sound is almost always an indication of a positive emotion or form of communication. Cats will use trilling as a way to communicate with other cats, as well as a form of communication with you. As long as you are happy to indulge your cat, you can even spend a few minutes in conversation with them, taking turns to exchange trills.

Conclusion

Cats have a range of ways of communicating their needs, as well as expressing their feelings. Trilling is simply another form of communication and typically a positive one. Whether your cat is greeting you, seeking some attention or petting, why not take the opportunity to trill back and engage in some fun communication with your cat?

Omdq2EvM1dQ,"Vladimir Putin announced in a speech last month that Russia had weathered the worst of the Economic sanctions imposed by Western nations. He said that “gloomy predictions about the Russian economy’s future didn’t come true” and that the sanctions had hit foreign economies much harder than they had hit Russia. He added that “The weaponry of sanctions is a double-edged sword… and European countries had dealt a serious blow to their own economies all on their own.” So are the sanctions on Russia working? Or Is Russia winning the Economic War?

► Forever Stranded: Lost Souls
Feeling cocky in this part of the galaxy will end up getting you killed. After escaping the treacherous heat of the vast desert planet on your last adventure, you got the ship up and running again. While using the hyperdrive to venture into uncharted space, you thought all was fine and dandy until… sirens shot off, piercing your brain like a sharp dagger. You stumbled over to the control panel to find out what the issue was and noticed that the damn hyperdrive had gone into meltdown. With a wrench in hand, you rush over to the hyperdrive core and try to fix any part of it that you can, but you are too late. The ship shook violently, causing all sorts of mechanical problems. With no hope left, your survival instincts had kicked in and urged you to try and use the working engine power to thrust your way out. The engines roared and threw the ship off course, plummeting the vessel out of hyperspace and into a blackhole. With low engine power and time needed to fix the hyperdrive, you had given up and let the abyss of the black hole determine your fate, thus, turning on the autopilot while you continued to tinker with the hyperdrive. The ship began shaking violently once more, throwing your body into the ceiling, knocking you out cold. Luckily, the autopilot had done its job and managed to land the ship safely in a nearby world. You rise from your slumber to the smell of foreign burning gasses, the sounds of faint screams, and the concept that you are in hell. Stepping out of your ship, you look around you and notice that you are not quite in hell, but you might as well be. It might be a good time to hang up the keys to flying ships and work on getting a proper piloting license because you are apparently the worse pilot in the galaxy.

Reboot :[{""command"":""ascset"", ""parameter"":""0,reboot,0""}]

It will run for several minutes maybe hours, depending on your Avalon version.

E-eDQHX78Vg,"The Half-Life and Portal timeline is long and complicated. Although these stories are set in different locations on Earth, they connect over the years. From Black Mesa's early years and their competition with Aperture Science, to the fall of Aperture and GLaDOS' attempts to keep The Combine out of her facility. This timeline has many important events.

In this video, I explore the whole history and story of Half-Life and Portal. Although Chell and Gordon Freeman never meet, their actions have a huge impact on Aperture Science, Black Mesa and the multiverse.

Better Call Saul is the prequel to the award-winning series Breaking Bad, set six years before Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) became Walter White's lawyer. When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is ""fixer"" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts ""criminal"" in ""criminal lawyer.""

His ashes are in a box right next to me and his memory will live in my heart for as long as I’m on this planet.    However, out little family needed a new family member and eventually I’m going to need a new companion to help me get around.  So….Steve.  He is a German Shorthaired Pointer and he is just 9 weeks old.   Wish us all luck!

In a time when most American workers can’t ever reasonably hope to retire, why would people with the option to live a life their peers can only dream of choose not to?

The simple truth is that people are both addicted to their work and feel as if they can’t leave.

Why they feel this way is still a bit of a mystery but looking at some leading theories tells a concerning story of how modern careers are making even the most secure workers feel very uneasy about their futures. 

So it’s time to learn How Money Works

More about Raft (from Steam):

By yourself or with friends, your mission is to survive an epic oceanic adventure across
a perilous sea! Gather debris to survive, expand your raft and be wary of the dangers of
the ocean!

Trapped on a small raft with nothing but a hook made of old plastic, players awake on a vast,
blue ocean totally alone and with no land in sight! With a dry throat and an empty stomach,
survival will not be easy!

Raft throws you and your friends into an epic adventure out on the big open sea, with the
objective to stay alive, gather resources and build yourself a floating home worthy of
survival.

Resources are tough to come by at sea: Players will have to make sure to catch whatever debris floats by using their trusty hook and when possible, scavenge the reefs beneath the waves and the islands above.
However, thirst and hunger is not the only danger in the ocean… watch out for the man-
eating shark determined to end your voyage!


Features:
● Multiplayer! Survive by yourself or with friends in online co-op!
● Hook! Use your hook to catch debris floating by.
● Craft! Build survival equipment, weapons, crop plots and more to help you stay alive!
● Build! Expand your raft from a simple wreckage to a buoyant mansion.
● Research! Learn new things to craft in the research table.
● Navigate! Sail your raft towards new places!
● Dive! Drop anchor and explore the depths for more resources.
● Fight! Defend your raft from the dangers of the ocean.",2020-10-17T14:00:00Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2yYsmzeVHaM/hqdefault.jpg,,20,,31108427,541925,13097,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4-5pmFNdKsY,"After two years of “flattening the curve”, America’s pandemic response has resulted in the flattening of wallets. An unprecedented amount of money printing has sent prices skyrocketing, and Americans trying to get their lives “back to normal” are experiencing anything but. 

Surprisingly, Amazon’s new “Reacher” series can teach us a lot about our inflationary woes. 

At the end of the day, the counterfeiting criminals in Reacher are nearly indistinguishable from the Federal Reserve pumping our financial system full of fiat fakery. In both situations, everyone’s money has less value because more dollars are chasing the same amount of goods and services. Let’s break it down further on this feature episode of Out of Frame.

leHb2hdCLqo,"Welcome to our amazing adventure! In this video, we'll be joining our hero Xavier Rosset on a real-life Robinson Crusoe adventure - 300 days alone on Tofua, a remote island of the Tonga in the Pacific Ocean.

We'll follow our hero as he embarks on a daring journey of exploration, discovery, and self-reliance. He'll be completely isolated from civilization, and must use his wits and skills to survive.
We'll start by watching him build a shelter, and gathering food and supplies. Then he'll have to figure out how to catch fish and hunt animals. He'll also need to make improvised tools, and explore the island.
And we'll watch as he adjusts to life on the island; dealing with storms, loneliness, and the possibility of never being rescued. We'll see how he copes with the mental and physical struggles of living alone in the wild.
It's a remarkable story of courage and determination, a true psychological story between solitude and loneliness and hopefully it will inspire others to try their own outdoor adventures. Join us now for this amazing Robinson Crusoe adventure!

After 3 minutes, you won't be willing to leave your screen.


Ce film existe aussi en version originale française , Xavier explique dans sa langue maternelle ses souffrances et ses joies. Cette version est un peu différente de celle en anglais.

Hygiene is a bit of a concern with this drink though, as the sticks of sugarcane are usually transported in dirty conditions and are often just stacked on the ground before going through the sugarcane press.

This video features experiments that have been shown to me by science teachers over the years. Does ice melt fast in salt water or fresh water was an experiment introduced to me at the Utah Science Teachers' conference. The ring of metal over a chain demo came from a teachers event in Florida. The idea shaking a carbonated drink increases pressure came from an email.

Special thanks to Petr Lebedev for building the pressure gauge.
